Manufacturing files for Mechano23 xover PCB.  The RAR file needs to be uploaded to the PCB vendor (eg: JLCPCB or PCBWAY etc).

How to order from JLCPCB :

NB : Use the "Add Gerber files" button to upload (mechano23_revA_plots.rar) RAR file.

BOM is as per component links in the first post of the ASR review here : https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/mechano23-open-source-diy-speaker-review.54066/

Alternatively see simple BOM here : mechano23_xover_schematic.xls

6.3mm PCB lugs are as per H2094.pdf from local electronics store (5mm pitch, 1.2mm pin)  These would fit : https://www.newark.com/ettinger/19-68-041/terminal-pc-quick-fit-1-1mm/dp/10AC9921 (1.1mm pin)

Closest mouser alternative I could find is : https://au.mouser.com/ProductDetail/TE-Connectivity-AMP/725964-2?qs=qCxwlXJ4fnwpPO7DZFi5oQ%3D%3D  Pins are 1.3mm in this case but should push into PCB holes with some gentle persuasion.  Could also try these : https://www.newark.com/multicomp-pro/pc250-836lt/terminal-tab-6-35mm-solder-uninsulated/dp/05R7934 (cheaper but also 1.3mm pin))

For inductors I used "Liquid Nails" and cable ties ("knot" on component side) to secure them to the PCB.  For all other parts a neutral cure silcone was used to ensure parts don't rattle and buzz on PCB.  Cable tie holes are 4mm.

PCB mounting holes are 4.3mm.  

**IMPORTANT - The inductor leads are coated with enamel.  You will need to scrape/sand the ends of the leads to remove the enamel before soldering.  A hobby knife and/or sandpaper can be used for this purpose.
