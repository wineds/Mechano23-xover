Manufacturing files for Mechano23 xover.  The RAR file needs to be uploaded to the PCB vendor (eg: JLCPCB or PCBWAY).

How to order from JLCPCB :

NB : Use the "Add Gerber files" button to upload (mechano23_revA_plots.rar) RAR file.

BOM is as per component links in the first page of the ASR review here : https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/mechano23-open-source-diy-speaker-review.54066/

6.3mm PCB lugs are as per H2094.pdf (5mm pitch, 1.2mm pin)  Closest mouser alternative I could find is : https://au.mouser.com/ProductDetail/TE-Connectivity-AMP/725964-2?qs=qCxwlXJ4fnwpPO7DZFi5oQ%3D%3D  Pins are 1.3mm in this case but should push into PCB holes with some gentle persuasion.  

For inductors I used "Liquid Nails" and cable ties to secure them to the PCB.  For all other parts a neutral cure silcone was used to ensure parts don't rattle and buzz on PCB.
