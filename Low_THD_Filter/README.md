Low Distortion Filter for Mechano23.

The filter needs to be placed in series with the woofer (either positive or negative terminal).

PCB lugs are the same as crossover PCB.

If you use the dayton 0.13mH inductor remove the cable tie furthest from the termination point and carefully start removing outer windings until only 4 remain.  This will result in a 0.11mH inductor.  Complete by adding a few new cable ties to aid mechancial stability.  I also applied some "liquid nails" to help keep the windings in place. viz:
